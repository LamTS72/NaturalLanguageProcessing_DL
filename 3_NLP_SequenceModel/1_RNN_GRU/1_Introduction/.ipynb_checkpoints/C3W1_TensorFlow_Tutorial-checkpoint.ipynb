On the other hand both training and validation losses are still decreasing, which means that while the model does not learn to predict more cases accurately, it still gets more confident in its predictions. Here you used the simplest possible model: you have used embeddings, averaging layer and a dense layer with one output. You can try different architectures to see if the model improves. Perhaps you can add some dropout layers to reduce the chance of overfitting, or you can try a completely different architecture, like using convolutional layers or reccurent layers. You will learn a lot more about recurrent neural networks in the later weeks of this course."

To do so, you can create a new sequential model where you merge the vectorization layer with your trained model using the weights you just trained."
