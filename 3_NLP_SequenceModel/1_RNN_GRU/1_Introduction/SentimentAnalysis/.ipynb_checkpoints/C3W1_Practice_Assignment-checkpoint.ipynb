    "Welcome to the first assignment of course 3. **This is a practice assignment**, which means that the grade you receive won't count towards your final grade of the course. **However you can still submit your solutions and receive a grade along with feedback from the grader.** Before getting started take some time to read the following tips: \n",

    "#### TIPS FOR SUCCESSFUL GRADING OF YOUR ASSIGNMENT:\n",
    "\n",
    "- All cells are frozen except for the ones where you need to submit your solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can add new cells to experiment but these will be omitted by the grader, so don't rely on newly created cells to host your solution code, use the provided places for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can add the comment # grade-up-to-here in any graded cell to signal the grader that it must only evaluate up to that point. This is helpful if you want to check if you are on the right track even if you are not done with the whole assignment. Be sure to remember to delete the comment afterwards!\n",
